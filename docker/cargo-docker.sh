# Key points for these cmd-line args:
#  * run a transient image that deletes itself on successful completion
#  * share cargo registry data with the image, so it doesn't have to re-fetch it each run
#  * mount the current working directory into the image, and run in that directory
#  * run via bash in interactive mode to get correct $PATH setup from .bashrc
