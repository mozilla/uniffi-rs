# Generating bindings

Bindings is the term used for the code generates for foreign languages which integrate
with Rust crates - that is, the generated Python, Swift or Kotlin code which drives the
examples.

UniFFI comes with a `uniffi_bindgen` which generates these bindings. For introductory
information, see [Foreign Language Bindings in the tutorial](./tutorial/foreign_language_bindings.md)

# Customizing the binding generation.

Each of the bindings reads a file `uniffi.toml` in the root of a crate which supports
various options which influence how the bindings are generated. Default options will be used
if this file is missing.

`--config` option can be used to specify additional uniffi config file. This config is merged with
the `uniffi.toml` config present in each crate, with its values taking precedence.

Each binding supports different options, so please see the documentation for each binding language.
