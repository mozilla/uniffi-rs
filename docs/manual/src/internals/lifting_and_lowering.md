# Lifting, Lowering and Serialization

UniFFI is able to transfer rich data types back-and-forth between the Rust
code and the foreign-language code via a process we refer to as "lowering"
and "lifting".

Recall that UniFFI interoperates between different languages by defining
a C-style FFI layer which operates in terms of primitive data types and
plain functions. To transfer data from one side of this layer to the other,
the sending side "***lowers***" the data from a language-specific data type
into one of the primitive types supported by the FFI-layer functions, and the
receiving side "***lifts***" that primitive type into its own language-specific
data type.

Lifting and lowering simple types such as integers is done by directly casting the
value to and from an appropriate type. For complex types such as optionals and
records we currently implement lifting and lowering by serializing into a byte
buffer, but this is an implementation detail that may change in future. (See
[ADR-0002](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/blob/main/docs/adr/0002-serialize-complex-datatypes.md) for the reasoning
behind this choice.)

As a concrete example, consider this interface for accumulating a list of integers:

```idl
namespace example {
  sequence<i32> add_to_list(i32 item);
}
```

Calling this function from foreign language code involves the following steps:

1. The user-provided calling code invokes the `add_to_list` function that is exposed by the
   UniFFI-generated foreign language bindings, passing `item` as an appropriate language-native
   integer.
2. The foreign language bindings ***lower*** each argument to a function call into
   something that can be passed over the C-style FFI. Since the `item` argument is a plain integer,
   it is lowered by casting to an `int32_t`.
3. The foreign language bindings pass the lowered arguments to a C FFI function named
   like `example_XYZ_add_to_list` that is exposed by the UniFFI-generated Rust scaffolding.
4. The Rust scaffolding ***lifts*** each argument received over the FFI into a native
   Rust type. Since `item` is a plain integer it is lifted by casting to a Rust `i32`.
5. The Rust scaffolding passes the lifted arguments to the user-provided Rust code for
   the `add_to_list` function, which returns a `Vec<i32>`.
6. The Rust scaffolding now needs to ***lower*** the return value in order to pass it back
   to the foreign language code. Since this is a complex data type, it is lowered by serializing
   the values into a byte buffer and returning the buffer pointer and length from the
   FFI function.
7. The foreign language bindings receive the return value and need to ***lift*** it into an
   appropriate native data type. Since it is a complex data type, it is lifted by deserializing
   from the returned byte buffer into a language-native list of integers.

## Lowered Types

| UDL Type | Representation in the C FFI |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| `i8`/`i16`/`i32`/`i64` | `int8_t`/`int16_t`/`int32_t`/`int64_t` |
| `u8`/`u16`/`u32`/`u64` | `uint8_t`/`uint16_t`/`uint32_t`/`uint64_t` |
| `f32`/`float` | `float` |
| `f64`/`double` | `double` |
| `boolean` | `int8_t`, either `0` or `1` |
| `string` | `RustBuffer` struct pointing to utf8 bytes |
| `bytes` | Same as `sequence<u8>` |
| `timestamp` | `RustBuffer` struct pointing to a i64 representing seconds and a u32 representing nanoseconds |
| `duration` | `RustBuffer` struct pointing to a u64 representing seconds and a u32 representing nanoseconds |
| `T?` | `RustBuffer` struct pointing to serialized bytes |
| `sequence<T>` | `RustBuffer` struct pointing to serialized bytes |
| `record<string, T>` | `RustBuffer` struct pointing to serialized bytes |
| `enum` and `[Enum] interface` | `RustBuffer` struct pointing to serialized bytes |
| `dictionary` | `RustBuffer` struct pointing to serialized bytes |
| `interface` | `void*` opaque pointer to object on the heap |


## Serialization Format

When serializing complex data types into a byte buffer, UniFFI uses an
ad-hoc fixed-width format which is designed mainly for simplicity.
The details of this format are internal only and may change between versions of UniFFI.

| UDL Type | Representation in serialized bytes |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| `i8`/`i16`/`i32`/`i64` | Fixed-width 1/2/4/8-byte signed integer, big-endian|
| `u8`/`u16`/`u32`/`u64` | Fixed-width 1/2/4/8-byte unsigned integer, big-endian |
| `f32`/`float` | Fixed-width 4-byte float, big-endian |
| `f64`/`double` | Fixed-width 8-byte double, big-endian |
| `boolean` | Fixed-width 1-byte signed integer, either `0` or `1` |
| `string` | Serialized `i32` length followed by utf-8 string bytes; no trailing null |
| `T?` | If null, serialized `boolean` false; if non-null, serialized `boolean` true followed by serialized `T` |
| `sequence<T>` | Serialized `i32` item count followed by serialized items; each item is a serialized `T` |
| `record<string, T>` | Serialized `i32` item count followed by serialized items; each item is a serialized `string` followed by a serialized `T` |
| `enum` and `[Enum] interface` | Serialized `i32` indicating variant, numbered in declaration order starting from 1, followed by the serialized values of the variant's fields in declaration order |
| `dictionary` | The serialized value of each field, in declaration order |
| `interface` | Fixed-width 8-byte unsigned integer encoding a pointer to the object on the heap |

Note that length fields in this format are serialized as *signed* integers
despite the fact that they will always be non-negative. This is to help
ease compatibility with JVM-based languages since the JVM uses signed 32-bit
integers for its size fields internally.

## Code Generation and the FfiConverter trait

UniFFI needs to generate Rust code to lift/lower types.  To help with this, we define the `FfiConverter` trait which contains the code to lift/lower/serialize a particular type.

The most straightforward approach would be to define `FfiConverter` on the type being lifted/lowered/serialized.  However, this wouldn't work for remote types defined in 3rd-party crates because of the Rust orphan rules.  For example, our crates can't implement `FfiConverter` on `serde_json::Value` because both the trait and the type are remote.

To work around this we do several things:

 - `FfiConverter` gets a generic type parameter.  This type is basically arbitrary and doesn't affect the lowering/lifting/serialization process.
 - We generate a unit struct named `UniFfiTag` in the root of each UniFFIed crate.
 - Each crate uses the `FfiConverter<crate::UniFfiTag>` trait to lower/lift/serialize values for its scaffolding functions.

This allows us to work around the orphan rules when defining `FfiConverter` implementations.
 - UniFFI consumer crates can implement lifting/lowering/serializing types for their own scaffolding functions, for example `impl FfiConverter<crate::UniFfiTag> for serde_json::Value`.  This is allowed since `UniFfiTag` is a local type.
 - The `uniffi` crate can implement lifting/lowering/serializing types for all scaffolding functions using a generic impl, for example `impl<UT> FfiConverter<UT> for u8`.  "UT" is short for "UniFFI Tag"
 - We don't currently use this, but crates can also implement lifting/lowering/serializing their local types for all scaffolding functions using a similar generic impl (`impl<UT> FfiConverter<UT> for MyLocalType`).

For more details on the specifics of the "orphan rule" and why these are legal implementations, see the [Rust Chalk Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/clauses/coherence.html#the-orphan-rules-in-rustc)
