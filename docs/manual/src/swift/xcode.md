# Integrating with XCode

It is possible to generate Swift bindings at compile time for XCode projects
and incorporate them alongside hand-written Swift code to form a larger module.
Broadly, you will need to:

1. Add a build phase to compile the Rust crate into a static lib and link it
   into your framework.
2. Add a build phase to run `uniffi-bindgen ` and generate the Swift bindings.
3. Include the generated bridging header into your overall bridging header.

There is also an example app in the UniFFI project repo that may be helpful.

## Compiling the Rust crate.

Sorry, configuring XCode to compile the Rust crate into a staticlib
is beyond the scope of this document. However you do so, make sure you
include the resulting `libexample.a` file in the "Link Binary with Libraries"
build phase for your framework.

## Generating the bindings

In the "Build Rules" section of your config, add a rule to process `.udl` files
using `uniffi-bindgen`. We recommend having it generate the output files
somewhere in your source tree, rather than in XCode's default `$DERIVED_FILE_DIR`;
this both helps with debugging the build output, and makes it easier to configure
how the generated files are used.

* Add a build rule processing files with names matching `*.udl`.
    * Use something like the following as the custom script:
        * `$HOME/.cargo/bin/uniffi-bindgen generate $INPUT_FILE_PATH --language swift --out-dir $INPUT_FILE_DIR/Generated`
    * Add both the `.swift` file and the generated bridging header as output files:
        * `$(INPUT_FILE_DIR)/Generated/$(INPUT_FILE_BASE).swift`
        * `$(INPUT_FILE_DIR)/Generated/uniffi_$(INPUT_FILE_BASE)-Bridging-Header.h`
* Add your `.udl` file to the "Compile Sources" build phase for your framework,
  so that XCode will process it using the new build rule and will include the resulting
  outputs in the build.

## Including the bridging header

In the overall bridging header for your module, include the bridging header
generated by UniFFI in the previous step:

```
#include "uniffi_example-Bridging-Header.h"
```

For this to work without complaint from XCode, you also need to add the
generated header file as a **Public** header in the "Headers" build phase
of your project (which is why it's useful to generate this file somewhere in
your source tree, rather than in temporary build directory).
