# Rust scaffolding

## Rust scaffolding code

Now we generate some Rust helper code to make the `add` method available to foreign-language bindings.  

First, add `uniffi` to your crate dependencies: it is the runtime support code that powers uniffi's serialization of data types across languages:

```toml
[dependencies]
uniffi = "0.5"
```

Important note: the `uniffi` version must be the same as the `uniffi-bindgen` command-line tool installed on your system.

Then let's add `uniffi_build` to your build dependencies: it generates the Rust scaffolding code that exposes our Rust functions as a C-compatible FFI layer.

```toml
[build-dependencies]
uniffi_build = "0.5"
```

Then create a `build.rs` file next to `Cargo.toml` that will use `uniffi_build`:

```rust
fn main() {
    uniffi_build::generate_scaffolding("./src/math.udl").unwrap();
}
```

**Note:** This is the equivalent of calling (and does it under the hood) `uniffi-bindgen scaffolding src/math.udl --out-dir <OUT_DIR>`.

Lastly, we include the generated scaffolding code in our `lib.rs`. If you've used the default build
settings then this can be done using a handy macro:

```rust
uniffi_macros::include_scaffolding!("math");
```

If you have generated the scaffolding in a custom location, use the standard `!include` macro
to include the generated file by name, like this:


```rust
include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/math.uniffi.rs"));
```

**Note:** The file name is always `<namespace>.uniffi.rs`.

Great! `add` is ready to see the outside world!
