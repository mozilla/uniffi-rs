# Rust scaffolding

UniFFI requires that our generated Rust "scaffolding" code is included in your project. For proc macros, most of this is conveniently generated by the macros.

If you use UDL files, you need to generate this "scaffolding" then include the generated .rs in your project.

## Rust scaffolding code for UDL

Crates using UDL need a `build.rs` file next to `Cargo.toml`. This uses `uniffi` to generate the Rust scaffolding code.

```rust
fn main() {
    uniffi::generate_scaffolding("src/math.udl").unwrap();
}
```

It will generate `<namespace>.uniffi.rs` under your `target` directory.

Lastly, we include the generated scaffolding code in our `lib.rs` using this handy macro:

```rust
uniffi::include_scaffolding!("math");
```

## Setup for crates using only proc macros

If you are only using proc macros, you can skip `build.rs` entirely!
All you need to do is add this to the top of `lib.rs`

```rust
uniffi::setup_scaffolding!();
```

Don't use `uniffi::setup_scaffolding!()` in a crate which uses `uniffi::include_scaffolding!()`.

If you don't specify a [`namespace`](../udl/namespace.md) the crate name is used.

### Libraries that depend on UniFFI components

Suppose you want to create a shared library that includes one or more
components using UniFFI. The typical way to achieve this is to create a new
crate that depends on the component crates.  However, this can run into
[rust-lang#50007](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50007).  Under
certain circumstances, the scaffolding functions that the component crates
export do not get re-exported by the dependent crate.

Use the `uniffi_reexport_scaffolding!` macro to work around this issue.  If your
library depends on `foo_component`, then add
`foo_component::uniffi_reexport_scaffolding!();` to your `lib.rs` file and
UniFFI will add workaround code that forces the functions to be re-exported.

Each scaffolding function contains a hash that's derived from the UDL file.
This avoids name collisions when combining multiple UniFFI components into
one library.
