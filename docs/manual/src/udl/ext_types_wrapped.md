# External types which wrap primitive types

*Note: The facility described in this document is not yet available for all foreign language
bindings.*

It's possible to expose types in your Rust crate to UniFFI, so long as the type can
be expressed as one of UniFFI's [builtin_types](./builtin_types.md).

For example, consider the following trivial Rust abstraction for a "handle" which wraps an
integer:

```rust
pub struct Handle(i64);
```

You can use this type in your udl by declaring it via a `typedef` with a `Wrapped` attribute,
defining the primitive type which it wraps.

```idl
[Wrapped]
typedef i64 Handle;
```

For this to work, your Rust code must also implement a special trait named
`UniffiCustomTypeWrapper`. This trait is generated by UniFFI and can be found in the generated
Rust scaffolding - it is defined as:

```Rust
trait UniffiCustomTypeWrapper {
    type Wrapped;

    fn wrap(val: Self::Wrapped) -> uniffi::Result<Self>
    where
        Self: Sized;
    fn unwrap(obj: Self) -> Self::Wrapped;
}
```

where `Wrapped` is the Rust type being wrapped - `i64` in the example above. Thus, the trait
implemention for `Handle` would look something like:

```rust
impl UniffiCustomTypeWrapper for Handle {
    type Wrapped = i64;

    fn wrap(val: Self::Wrapped) -> uniffi::Result<Self> {
        Ok(Handle(val))
    }

    fn unwrap(obj: Self) -> Self::Wrapped {
        obj.0
    }
}
```

Because `UniffiCustomTypeWrapper` is defined in each crate, this means you can wrap objects even
if they are not defined in your crate - see the 'wrapper_types' example which demonstrates
how `serde_json::Value` can be wrapped.

## Custom Foreign Wrappers

In the example above, the foreign bindings just see the "wrapped" value - eg, the bindings will
get an integer for the `Handle`.

We intend on making it possible to customize this - for example, `serde_json::Value` could be
transformed into a suitable JSON object in the bindings.

## Using Wrapped Types from other crates

To use the `Handle` example above from another crate, these other crates just refer to the type
as a regular `External` type - for example, another crate might use `udl` such as:

```idl
[External="crate_defining_handle_name"]
typedef extern Handle;
```
