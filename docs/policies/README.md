# Policies

This directory contains the current policies for the `uniffi` project. Unlike
our [Architectural Decision Records](../adr), the documents here should be
considered living documents - they will be updated as the policies change.

The policies might include things like what version of Rust we track, how
often we make releases, what requirements exists for PRs from contributors,
etc.
