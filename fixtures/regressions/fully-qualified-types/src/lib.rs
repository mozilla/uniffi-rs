// The point of this test is that we don't have any of the used Rust types
// in scope under their usual names, so we don't import the ones that aren't
// in the prelude, and we overrwrite the ones that are.
//
// Real Rust code wouldn't do this of course, but it's nice to be robust
// against it.
//
// We could consider giving `String` and `Box` similar treatment in future,
// but our use of those as unqualified names is not a recent regression,
// so that's for follow-up work.
