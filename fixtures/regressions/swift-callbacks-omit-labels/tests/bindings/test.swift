// Regression test for https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/issues/1312
//
// Really this can be detected at compile time:
// We didn't apply the same `omit_argument_labels` configuration to callbacks,
// leading to a compilation error.
// To make sure everything gets called right though we write a full test here.
