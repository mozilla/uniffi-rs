error[E0277]: `Cell<u32>` cannot be shared between threads safely

  | struct r#Counter { }

  = help: within `Counter`, the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `Cell<u32>`
  = note: if you want to do aliasing and mutation between multiple threads, use `std::sync::RwLock` or `std::sync::atomic::AtomicU32` instead
note: required because it appears within the type `Counter`
