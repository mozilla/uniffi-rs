<p>It is sometimes useful to be able to rely upon a certain value not being able to <em>move</em>,
in the sense that its address in memory cannot change. This is useful especially when there
are one or more <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.pointer.html" title="primitive pointer"><em>pointers</em></a> pointing at that value. The ability to rely on this
guarantee that the value a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.pointer.html" title="primitive pointer">pointer</a> is pointing at (its <strong>pointee</strong>) will</p>
<ol>
<li>Not be <em>moved</em> out of its memory location</li>
<li>More generally, remain <em>valid</em> at that same memory location</li>
</ol>
<p>is called “pinning.” We would say that a value which satisfies these guarantees has been
“pinned,” in that it has been permanently (until the end of its lifespan) attached to its
location in memory, as though pinned to a pinboard. Pinning a value is an incredibly useful
building block for <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> code to be able to reason about whether a raw pointer to the
pinned value is still valid. <a href="index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee" title="mod uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin">As we’ll see later</a>, this is necessarily from the
time the value is first pinned until the end of its lifespan. This concept of “pinning” is
necessary to implement safe interfaces on top of things like self-referential types and
intrusive data structures which cannot currently be modeled in fully safe Rust using only
borrow-checked <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference">references</a>.</p>
<p>“Pinning” allows us to put a <em>value</em> which exists at some location in memory into a state where
safe code cannot <em>move</em> that value to a different location in memory or otherwise invalidate it
at its current location (unless it implements <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>, which we will
<a href="index.html#unpin" title="mod uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin">talk about below</a>). Anything that wants to interact with the pinned value in a way
that has the potential to violate these guarantees must promise that it will not actually
violate them, using the <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> keyword to mark that such a promise is upheld by the user
and not the compiler. In this way, we can allow other <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> code to rely on any pointers
that point to the pinned value to be valid to dereference while it is pinned.</p>
<p>Note that as long as you don’t use <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a>, it’s impossible to create or misuse a pinned
value in a way that is unsound. See the documentation of <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> for more
information on the practicalities of how to pin a value and how to use that pinned value from a
user’s perspective without using <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a>.</p>

that are implementing the <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> pieces of an interface that relies on pinning for validity;
users of <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> in safe code do not need to read it in detail.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-moving"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#what-is-moving">§</a>What is “<em>moving</em>”?</h2>
<p>When we say a value is <em>moved</em>, we mean that the compiler copies, byte-for-byte, the
value from one location to another. In a purely mechanical sense, this is identical to
<a href="../marker/trait.Copy.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Copy"><code>Copy</code></a>ing a value from one place in memory to another. In Rust, “move” carries with it the
semantics of ownership transfer from one variable to another, which is the key difference
between a <a href="../marker/trait.Copy.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Copy"><code>Copy</code></a> and a move. For the purposes of this module’s documentation, however, when
we write <em>move</em> in italics, we mean <em>specifically</em> that the value has <em>moved</em> in the mechanical
sense of being located at a new place in memory.</p>
<p>All values in Rust are trivially <em>moveable</em>. This means that the address at which a value is
located is not necessarily stable in between borrows. The compiler is allowed to <em>move</em> a value
to a new address without running any code to notify that value that its address
has changed. Although the compiler will not insert memory <em>moves</em> where no semantic move has
occurred, there are many places where a value <em>may</em> be moved. For example, when doing
assignment or passing a value into a function.</p>

<p>In this sense, Rust does not guarantee that <code>check_for_move()</code> will never panic, because the
compiler is permitted to <em>move</em> <code>tracker</code> in many situations.</p>
<p>Common smart-pointer types such as <a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut T</code></a> also allow <em>moving</em> the underlying
<em>value</em> they point at: you can move out of a <a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, or you can use <a href="../mem/fn.replace.html" title="fn uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::mem::replace"><code>mem::replace</code></a> to
move a <code>T</code> out of a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut T</code></a>. Therefore, putting a value (such as <code>tracker</code> above) behind a
pointer isn’t enough on its own to ensure that its address does not change.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pinning"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#what-is-pinning">§</a>What is “pinning”?</h2>
<p>We say that a value has been <em>pinned</em> when it has been put into a state where it is guaranteed
to remain <em>located at the same place in memory</em> from the time it is pinned until its
<a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> is called.</p>
<h3 id="address-sensitive-values-aka-when-we-need-pinning"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#address-sensitive-values-aka-when-we-need-pinning">§</a>Address-sensitive values, AKA “when we need pinning”</h3>
<p>Most values in Rust are entirely okay with being <em>moved</em> around at-will.
Types for which it is <em>always</em> the case that <em>any</em> value of that type can be
<em>moved</em> at-will should implement <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>, which we will discuss more <a href="index.html#unpin" title="mod uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin">below</a>.</p>
<p><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a> is specifically targeted at allowing the implementation of <em>safe interfaces</em> around
types which have some state during which they become “address-sensitive.” A value in such an
“address-sensitive” state is <em>not</em> okay with being <em>moved</em> around at-will. Such a value must
stay <em>un-moved</em> and valid during the address-sensitive portion of its lifespan because some
interface is relying on those invariants to be true in order for its implementation to be sound.</p>
<p>As a motivating example of a type which may become address-sensitive, consider a type which
contains a pointer to another piece of its own data, <em>i.e.</em> a “self-referential” type. In order
for such a type to be implemented soundly, the pointer which points into <code>self</code>’s data must be
proven valid whenever it is accessed. But if that value is <em>moved</em>, the pointer will still
point to the old address where the value was located and not into the new location of <code>self</code>,
thus becoming invalid. A key example of such self-referential types are the state machines
generated by the compiler to implement <a href="../future/trait.Future.html" title="future::Future"><code>Future</code></a> for <code>async fn</code>s.</p>
<p>Such types that have an <em>address-sensitive</em> state usually follow a lifecycle
that looks something like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>A value is created which can be freely moved around.
<ul>
<li>e.g. calling an async function which returns a state machine implementing <a href="../future/trait.Future.html" title="future::Future"><code>Future</code></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An operation causes the value to depend on its own address not changing
<ul>
<li>e.g. calling <a href="../future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll" title="future::Future::poll"><code>poll</code></a> for the first time on the produced <a href="../future/trait.Future.html" title="future::Future"><code>Future</code></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Further pieces of the safe interface of the type use internal <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> operations which
assume that the address of the value is stable
<ul>
<li>e.g. subsequent calls to <a href="../future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll" title="future::Future::poll"><code>poll</code></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before the value is invalidated (e.g. deallocated), it is <em>dropped</em>, giving it a chance to
notify anything with pointers to itself that those pointers will be invalidated
<ul>
<li>e.g. <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a>ping the <a href="../future/trait.Future.html" title="future::Future"><code>Future</code></a> <sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two possible ways to ensure the invariants required for 2. and 3. above (which
apply to any address-sensitive type, not just self-referrential types) do not get broken.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have the value detect when it is moved and update all the pointers that point to itself.</li>
<li>Guarantee that the address of the value does not change (and that memory is not re-used
for anything else) during the time that the pointers to it are expected to be valid to
dereference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since, as we discussed, Rust can move values without notifying them that they have moved, the
first option is ruled out.</p>
<p>In order to implement the second option, we must in some way enforce its key invariant,
<em>i.e.</em> prevent the value from being <em>moved</em> or otherwise invalidated (you may notice this
sounds an awful lot like the definition of <em>pinning</em> a value). There a few ways one might be
able to enforce this invariant in Rust:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer a wholly <code>unsafe</code> API to interact with the object, thus requiring every caller to
uphold the invariant themselves</li>
<li>Store the value that must not be moved behind a carefully managed pointer internal to
the object</li>
<li>Leverage the type system to encode and enforce this invariant by presenting a restricted
API surface to interact with <em>any</em> object that requires these invariants</li>
</ol>
<p>The first option is quite obviously undesirable, as the <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a>ty of the interface will
become viral throughout all code that interacts with the object.</p>
<p>The second option is a viable solution to the problem for some use cases, in particular
for self-referrential types. Under this model, any type that has an address sensitive state
would ultimately store its data in something like a <a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, carefully manage internal
access to that data to ensure no <em>moves</em> or other invalidation occurs, and finally
provide a safe interface on top.</p>
<p>There are a couple of linked disadvantages to using this model. The most significant is that
each individual object must assume it is <em>on its own</em> to ensure
that its data does not become <em>moved</em> or otherwise invalidated. Since there is no shared
contract between values of different types, an object cannot assume that others interacting
with it will properly respect the invariants around interacting with its data and must
therefore protect it from everyone. Because of this, <em>composition</em> of address-sensitive types
requires at least a level of pointer indirection each time a new object is added to the mix
(and, practically, a heap allocation).</p>
<p>Although there were other reason as well, this issue of expensive composition is the key thing
that drove Rust towards adopting a different model. It is particularly a problem
when one considers, for exapmle, the implications of composing together the <a href="../future/trait.Future.html" title="future::Future"><code>Future</code></a>s which
will eventaully make up an asynchronous task (including address-sensitive <code>async fn</code> state
machines). It is plausible that there could be many layers of <a href="../future/trait.Future.html" title="future::Future"><code>Future</code></a>s composed together,
including multiple layers of <code>async fn</code>s handling different parts of a task. It was deemed
unacceptable to force indirection and allocation for each layer of composition in this case.</p>
<p><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> is an implementation of the third option. It allows us to solve the issues
discussed with the second option by building a <em>shared contractual language</em> around the
guarantees of “pinning” data.</p>
<h3 id="using-pinptr-to-pin-values"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#using-pinptr-to-pin-values">§</a>Using <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> to pin values</h3>
<p>In order to pin a value, we wrap a <em>pointer to that value</em> (of some type <code>Ptr</code>) in a
<a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a>. <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> can wrap any pointer type, forming a promise that the <strong>pointee</strong>
will not be <em>moved</em> or <a href="index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee" title="mod uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin">otherwise invalidated</a>.</p>
<p>We call such a <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a>-wrapped pointer a <strong>pinning pointer,</strong> (or pinning reference, or pinning
<code>Box</code>, etc.) because its existence is the thing that is conceptually pinning the underlying
pointee in place: it is the metaphorical “pin” securing the data in place on the pinboard
(in memory).</p>
<p>Notice that the thing wrapped by <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a> is not the value which we want to pin itself, but
rather a pointer to that value! A <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> does not pin the <code>Ptr</code>; instead, it pins the
pointer’s <em><strong>pointee</strong> value</em>.</p>
<h4 id="pinning-as-a-library-contract"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#pinning-as-a-library-contract">§</a>Pinning as a library contract</h4>
<p>Pinning does not require nor make use of any compiler “magic”<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>, only a specific
contract between the <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> parts of a library API and its users.</p>
<p>It is important to stress this point as a user of the <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> parts of the <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a> API.
Practically, this means that performing the mechanics of “pinning” a value by creating a
<a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> to it <em>does not</em> actually change the way the compiler behaves towards the
inner value! It is possible to use incorrect <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> code to create a <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> to a
value which does not actually satisfy the invariants that a pinned value must satisfy, and in
this way lead to undefined behavior even in (from that point) fully safe code. Similarly, using
<a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a>, one may get access to a bare <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut T</code></a> from a <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> and
use that to invalidly <em>move</em> the pinned value out. It is the job of the user of the
<a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> parts of the <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a> API to ensure these invariants are not violated.</p>
<p>This differs from e.g. <a href="../cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::cell::UnsafeCell"><code>UnsafeCell</code></a> which changes the semantics of a program’s compiled
output. A <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> is a handle to a value which we have promised we will not move out of,
but Rust still considers all values themselves to be fundamentally moveable through, <em>e.g.</em>
assignment or <a href="../mem/fn.replace.html" title="fn uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::mem::replace"><code>mem::replace</code></a>.</p>
<h4 id="how-pin-prevents-misuse-in-safe-code"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#how-pin-prevents-misuse-in-safe-code">§</a>How <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a> prevents misuse in safe code</h4>
<p>In order to accomplish the goal of pinning the pointee value, <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> restricts access to
the wrapped <code>Ptr</code> type in safe code. Specifically, <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a> disallows the ability to access
the wrapped pointer in ways that would allow the user to <em>move</em> the underlying pointee value or
otherwise re-use that memory for something else without using <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a>. For example, a

<p>Note that this invariant is enforced by simply making it impossible to call code that would
perform a move on the pinned value. This is the case since the only way to access that pinned

<p>The vast majority of Rust types have no address-sensitive states. These types
implement the <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> auto-trait, which cancels the restrictive effects of
<a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a> when the <em>pointee</em> type <code>T</code> is <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>.

<code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html" title="Box">Box</a>&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> functions identically to a non-pinning <a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a>; similarly,
<code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="mutable reference">&amp;mut</a> T&gt;</code> would impose no additional restrictions above a regular
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut T</code></a>.</p>
<p>The idea of this trait is to alleviate the reduced ergonomics of APIs that require the use
of <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a> for soundness for some types, but which also want to be used by other types that
don’t care about pinning. The prime example of such an API is <a href="../future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::future::Future::poll"><code>Future::poll</code></a>. There are many
<a href="../future/trait.Future.html" title="future::Future"><code>Future</code></a> types that don’t care about pinning. These futures can implement <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> and
therefore get around the pinning related restrictions in the API, while still allowing the
subset of <a href="../future/trait.Future.html" title="future::Future"><code>Future</code></a>s which <em>do</em> require pinning to be implemented soundly.</p>
<p>Note that the interaction between a <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> and <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> is through the type of the
<strong>pointee</strong> value, <a href="../ops/trait.Deref.html#associatedtype.Target" title="ops::Deref::Target"><code>&lt;Ptr as Deref&gt;::Target</code></a>. Whether the <code>Ptr</code> type itself
implements <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> does not affect the behavior of a <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a>. For example, whether or not
<a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html" title="Box"><code>Box</code></a> is <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> has no effect on the behavior of <code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html" title="Box">Box</a>&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, because
<code>T</code> is the type of the pointee value, not <a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html" title="Box"><code>Box</code></a>. So, whether <code>T</code> implements <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> is
the thing that will affect the behavior of the <code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html" title="Box">Box</a>&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Builtin types that are <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> include all of the primitive types, like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.bool.html" title="primitive bool"><code>bool</code></a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.i32.html" title="primitive i32"><code>i32</code></a>,
and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.f32.html" title="primitive f32"><code>f32</code></a>, references (<code><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="shared reference">&amp;</a>T</code> and <code><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="mutable reference">&amp;mut</a> T</code>), etc., as well as many
core and standard library types like <a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, <a href="../../std/string/struct.String.html" title="String"><code>String</code></a>, and more.
These types are marked <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> because they do not have an ddress-sensitive state like the
ones we discussed above. If they did have such a state, those parts of their interface would be
unsound without being expressed through pinning, and they would then need to not
implement <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>.</p>
<p>The compiler is free to take the conservative stance of marking types as <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> so long as
all of the types that compose its fields are also <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>. This is because if a type
implements <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>, then it is unsound for that type’s implementation to rely on
pinning-related guarantees for soundness, <em>even</em> when viewed through a “pinning” pointer! It is
the responsibility of the implementor of a type that relies upon pinning for soundness to
ensure that type is <em>not</em> marked as <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> by adding <a href="../marker/struct.PhantomPinned.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::PhantomPinned"><code>PhantomPinned</code></a> field. This is
exactly what we did with our <code>AddrTracker</code> example above. Without doing this, you <em>must not</em>
rely on pinning-related guarantees to apply to your type!</p>
<p>If need to truly pin a value of a foreign or built-in type that implements <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>, you’ll
need to create your own wrapper type around the <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> type you want to pin and then
opts-out of <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> using <a href="../marker/struct.PhantomPinned.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::PhantomPinned"><code>PhantomPinned</code></a>.</p>
<p>Exposing access to the inner field which you want to remain pinned must then be carefully
considered as well! Remember, exposing a method that gives access to a
<code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="mutable reference">&amp;mut</a> InnerT&gt;&gt;</code> where <code>InnerT: [Unpin]</code> would allow safe code to trivially
move the inner value out of that pinning pointer, which is precisely what you’re seeking to
prevent! Exposing a field of a pinned value through a pinning pointer is called “projecting”
a pin, and the more general case of deciding in which cases a pin should be able to be
projected or not is called “structural pinning.” We will go into more detail about this
<a href="index.html#projections-and-structural-pinning" title="mod uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin">below</a>.</p>

<h3 id="an-intrusive-doubly-linked-list"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#an-intrusive-doubly-linked-list">§</a>An intrusive, doubly-linked list</h3>
<p>In an intrusive doubly-linked list, the collection itself does not own the memory in which
each of its elements is stored. Instead, each client is free to allocate space for elements it
adds to the list in whichever manner it likes, including on the stack! Elements can live on a
stack frame that lives shorter than the collection does provided the elements that live in a
given stack frame are removed from the list before going out of scope.</p>
<p>To make such an intrusive data structure work, every element stores pointers to its predecessor
and successor within its own data, rather than having the list structure itself managing those
pointers. It is in this sense that the structure is “intrusive”: the details of how an
element is stored within the larger structure “intrudes” on the implementation of the element
type itself!</p>
<p>The full implementation details of such a data structure are outside the scope of this
documentation, but we will discuss how <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a> can help to do so.</p>
<p>Using such an intrusive pattern, elements may only be added when they are pinned. If we think
about the consequences of adding non-pinned values to such a list, this becomes clear:</p>
<p><em>Moving</em> or otherwise invalidating an element’s data would invalidate the pointers back to it
which are stored in the elements ahead and behind it. Thus, in order to soundly dereference
the pointers stored to the next and previous elements, we must satisfy the guarantee that
nothing has invalidated those pointers (which point to data that we do not own).</p>
<p>Moreover, the <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop"><code>Drop</code></a> implementation of each element must in some way notify its
predecessor and successor elements that it should be removed from the list before it is fully
destroyed, otherwise the pointers back to it would again become invalidated.</p>
<p>Crucially, this means we have to be able to rely on <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> always being called before an
element is invalidated. If an element could be deallocated or otherwise invalidated without
calling <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a>, the pointers to it stored in its neighboring elements would
become invalid, which would break the data structure.</p>
<p>Therefore, pinning data also comes with <a href="index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee" title="mod uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin">the “<code>Drop</code> guarantee”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee">§</a>Subtle details and the <code>Drop</code> guarantee</h2>
<p>The purpose of pinning is not <em>just</em> to prevent a value from being <em>moved</em>, but more
generally to be able to rely on the pinned value <em>remaining valid <strong>at a specific place</strong></em> in
memory.</p>
<p>To do so, pinning a value adds an <em>additional</em> invariant that must be upheld in order for use
of the pinned data to be valid, on top of the ones that must be upheld for a non-pinned value
of the same type to be valid:</p>
<p>From the moment a value is pinned by constructing a <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a>ning pointer to it, that value
must <em>remain, <strong>valid</strong></em>, at that same address in memory, <em>until its <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> handler is
called.</em></p>
<p>There is some subtlety to this which we have not yet talked about in detail. The invariant
described above means that, yes,</p>
<ol>
<li>The value must not be moved out of its location in memory</li>
</ol>
<p>but it also implies that,</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The memory location that stores the value must not get invalidated or otherwise repurposed
during the lifespan of the pinned value until its <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> returns or panics</li>
</ol>
<p>This point is subtle but required for intrusive data structures to be implemented soundly.</p>
<h3 id="drop-guarantee"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#drop-guarantee">§</a><code>Drop</code> guarantee</h3>
<p>There needs to be a way for a pinned value to notify any code that is relying on its pinned
status that it is about to be destroyed. In this way, the dependent code can remove the
pinned value’s address from its data structures or otherwise change its behavior with the
knowledge that it can no longer rely on that value existing at the location it was pinned to.</p>
<p>Thus, in any situation where we may want to overwrite a pinned value, that value’s <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> must
be called beforehand (unless the pinned value implements <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>, in which case we can ignore
all of <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a>’s guarantees, as usual).</p>
<p>The most common storage-reuse situations occur when a value on the stack is destroyed as part
of a function return and when heap storage is freed. In both cases, <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> gets run for us
by Rust when using standard safe code. However, for manual heap allocations or otherwise
custom-allocated storage, <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> code must make sure to call <a href="../ptr/fn.drop_in_place.html" title="fn uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ptr::drop_in_place"><code>ptr::drop_in_place</code></a> before
deallocating and re-using said storage.</p>
<p>In addition, storage “re-use”/invalidation can happen even if no storage is (de-)allocated.
For example, if we had an <a href="../option/enum.Option.html" title="enum uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::option::Option"><code>Option</code></a> which contained a <code>Some(v)</code> where <code>v</code> is pinned, then <code>v</code>
would be invalidated by setting that option to <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a <a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html" title="Vec"><code>Vec</code></a> was used to store pinned values and <a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.set_len" title="Vec::set_len"><code>Vec::set_len</code></a> was used to
manually “kill” some elements of a vector, all of the items “killed” would become invalidated,
which would be <em>undefined behavior</em> if those items were pinned.</p>
<p>Both of these cases are somewhat contrived, but it is crucial to remember that <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a>ned data
<em>must</em> be <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a>ped before it is invalidated; not just to prevent memory leaks, but as a
matter of soundness. As a corollary, the following code can <em>never</em> be made safe:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="comment">// Pin something inside a `ManuallyDrop`. This is fine on its own.
</span><span class="kw">let </span><span class="kw-2">mut </span>pin: Pin&lt;Box&lt;ManuallyDrop&lt;Type&gt;&gt;&gt; = Box::pin(ManuallyDrop::new(Type));

<span class="comment">// However, creating a pinning mutable reference to the type *inside*

</span><span class="kw">let </span>inner: Pin&lt;<span class="kw-2">&amp;mut </span>Type&gt; = <span class="kw">unsafe </span>{
    Pin::map_unchecked_mut(pin.as_mut(), |x| <span class="kw-2">&amp;mut **</span>x)
};</code></pre></div>
<p>Because <a href="../mem/struct.ManuallyDrop.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::mem::ManuallyDrop"><code>mem::ManuallyDrop</code></a> inhibits the destructor of <code>Type</code>, it won’t get run when the
<code><a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html" title="Box">Box</a>&lt;<a href="../mem/struct.ManuallyDrop.html" title="ManuallyDrop">ManuallyDrop</a>&lt;Type&gt;&gt;</code> is dropped, thus violating the drop guarantee of the

<p>Of course, <em>leaking</em> memory in such a way that its underlying storage will never get invalidated
or re-used is still fine: <a href="../mem/fn.forget.html" title="mem::forget"><code>mem::forget</code></a>ing a <a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> prevents its storage from ever getting
re-used, so the <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> guarantee is still satisfied.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-an-address-sensitive-type"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#implementing-an-address-sensitive-type">§</a>Implementing an address-sensitive type.</h2>
<p>This section goes into detail on important considerations for implementing your own

<p>The <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> function takes <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut self</code></a>, but this is called <em>even if that <code>self</code> has been

indeed in an address-sensitive state before <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> was called, it is as if the compiler
automatically called <a href="struct.Pin.html#method.get_unchecked_mut" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin::get_unchecked_mut"><code>Pin::get_unchecked_mut</code></a>.</p>
<p>This can never cause a problem in purely safe code because creating a pinning pointer to
a type which has an address-sensitive (thus does not implement <code>Unpin</code>) requires <code>unsafe</code>,
but it is important to note that choosing to take advantage of pinning-related guarantees
to justify validity in the implementation of your type has consequences for that type’s
<a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop"><code>Drop</code></a> implementation as well: if an element of your type could have been pinned,
you must treat <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop"><code>Drop</code></a> as implicitly taking <code>self: <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="mutable reference">&amp;mut</a> Self&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>You should implement <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>Drop</code></a> as follows:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">impl </span>Drop <span class="kw">for </span>Type {
    <span class="kw">fn </span>drop(<span class="kw-2">&amp;mut </span><span class="self">self</span>) {

<p>The function <code>inner_drop</code> has the signature that <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> <em>should</em> have in this situation.
This makes sure that you do not accidentally use <code>self</code>/<code>this</code> in a way that is in conflict
with pinning’s invariants.</p>
<p>Moreover, if your type is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/other-reprs.html#reprpacked"><code>#[repr(packed)]</code></a>, the compiler will automatically
move fields around to be able to drop them. It might even do
that for fields that happen to be sufficiently aligned. As a consequence, you cannot use
pinning with a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/other-reprs.html#reprpacked"><code>#[repr(packed)]</code></a> type.</p>

<p>It should further be noted that creating a pinning pointer of some type <code>Ptr</code> <em>also</em> carries

a pinning pointer, you must also take the same care described above not to <em>move</em> out of or
otherwise invalidate the pointee during <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>Drop</code></a>, <a href="../ops/trait.Deref.html" title="ops::Deref"><code>Deref</code></a>, or <a href="../ops/trait.DerefMut.html" title="ops::DerefMut"><code>DerefMut</code></a>
implementations.</p>
<h3 id="assigning-pinned-data"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#assigning-pinned-data">§</a>“Assigning” pinned data</h3>
<p>Although in general it is not valid to swap data or assign through a <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> for the same
reason that reusing a pinned object’s memory is invalid, it is possible to do validly when
implemented with special care for the needs of the exact data structure which is being
modified. For example, the assigning function must know how to update all uses of the pinned
address (and any other invariants necessary to satisfy validity for that type). For
<a href="#a-self-referential-struct"><code>Unmovable</code></a> (from the example above), we could write an assignment function like so:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">impl </span>Unmovable {

<p>Even though we can’t have the compiler do the assignment for us, it’s possible to write
such specialized functions for types that might need it.</p>
<p>Note that it <em>is</em> possible to assign generically through a <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin&lt;Ptr&gt;</code></a> by way of <a href="struct.Pin.html#method.set" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin::set"><code>Pin::set()</code></a>.
This does not violate any guarantees, since it will run <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> on the pointee value before
assigning the new value. Thus, the <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> implementation still has a chance to perform the
necessary notifications to dependent values before the memory location of the original pinned
value is overwritten.</p>
<h3 id="projections-and-structural-pinning"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#projections-and-structural-pinning">§</a>Projections and Structural Pinning</h3>
<p>With ordinary structs, it is natural that we want to add <em>projection</em> methods that allow
borrowing one or more of the inner fields of a struct when the caller has access to a
borrow of the whole struct:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">struct </span>Struct {
    field: Field,
    <span class="comment">// ...
</span>}

<span class="kw">impl </span>Struct {

}</code></pre></div>
<p>When working with address-sensitive types, it’s not obvious what the signature of these
functions should be. If <code>field</code> takes <code>self: <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="mutable reference">&amp;mut Struct</a>&gt;</code>, should it
return <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut Field</code></a> or <code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut Field</code></a>&gt;</code>? This question also arises with
<code>enum</code>s and wrapper types like <a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, <a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, and <a href="../cell/struct.RefCell.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::cell::RefCell"><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. (This question
applies just as well to shared references, but we’ll examine the more common case of mutable
references for illustration)</p>
<p>It turns out that it’s up to the author of <code>Struct</code> to decide which type the “projection”
should produce. The choice must be <em>consistent</em> though: if a pin is projected to a field
in one place, then it should very likely not be exposed elsewhere without projecting the
pin.</p>
<p>As the author of a data structure, you get to decide for each field whether pinning
“propagates” to this field or not. Pinning that propagates is also called “structural”,
because it follows the structure of the type.</p>
<p>This choice depends on what guarantees you need from the field for your <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> code to work.
If the field is itself address-sensitive, or participates in the parent struct’s address
sensitivity, it will need to be structurally pinned.</p>
<p>A useful test is if <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> code that consumes <code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="mutable reference">&amp;mut Struct</a>&gt;</code>
also needs to take note of the address of the field itself, it may be evidence that that field
is structurally pinned. Unfortunately, there are no hard-and-fast rules.</p>
<h4 id="choosing-pinning-not-to-be-structural-for-field"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#choosing-pinning-not-to-be-structural-for-field">§</a>Choosing pinning <em>not to be</em> structural for <code>field</code>…</h4>
<p>While counter-intuitive, it’s often the easier choice: if you do not expose a
<code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="mutable reference">&amp;mut</a> Field&gt;</code>, you do not need to be careful about other code
moving out of that field, you just have to ensure is that you never create pinning
reference to that field. This does of course also mean that if you decide a field does not
have structural pinning, you must not write <a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a> code that assumes (invalidly) that the
field <em>is</em> structurally pinned!</p>
<p>Fields without structural pinning may have a projection method that turns

<code>field</code> is not <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>. Since we have explicitly chosen not to care about pinning guarantees

<p>The other option is to decide that pinning is “structural” for <code>field</code>,
meaning that if the struct is pinned then so is the field.</p>
<p>This allows writing a projection that creates a <code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut Field</code></a>&gt;</code>, thus

<p>Structural pinning comes with a few extra requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Structural <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>.</em> A struct can be <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> only if all of its
structurally-pinned fields are, too. This is <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>’s behavior by default.
However, as a libray author, it is your responsibility not to write something like
<code>impl&lt;T&gt; <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin">Unpin</a> for Struct&lt;T&gt; {}</code> and then offer a method that provides
structural pinning to an inner field of <code>T</code>, which may not be <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>! (Adding <em>any</em>
projection operation requires unsafe code, so the fact that <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> is a safe trait does
not break the principle that you only have to worry about any of this if you use
<a href="../../std/keyword.unsafe.html" title="keyword unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pinned Destruction.</em> As discussed <a href="index.html#implementing-drop-for-types-with-address-sensitive-states" title="mod uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin">above</a>, <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> takes

<p>As a consequence, the struct <em>must not</em> be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/other-reprs.html#reprpacked"><code>#[repr(packed)]</code></a>.</p>

<p><em>Structural Notice of Destruction.</em> You must uphold the the

can fail to call <a href="../ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::ops::Drop::drop"><code>drop</code></a> on all elements if one of the destructors panics. This violates
the <a href="index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee" title="mod uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin"><code>Drop</code> guarantee</a>, because it can lead to elements being deallocated
without their destructor being called.</p>
<p><a href="../../std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html"><code>VecDeque&lt;T&gt;</code></a> has no pinning projections, so its destructor is sound. If it wanted
to provide such structural pinning, its destructor would need to abort the process if any
of the destructors panicked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must not offer any other operations that could lead to data being <em>moved</em> out of
the structural fields when your type is pinned. For example, if the struct contains an
<a href="../option/enum.Option.html" title="enum uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::option::Option"><code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code></a> and there is a <a href="../option/enum.Option.html#method.take" title="method uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::option::Option::take"><code>take</code></a>-like operation with type
<code>fn(<a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="mutable reference">&amp;mut Struct&lt;T&gt;</a>&gt;) -&gt; <a href="../option/enum.Option.html" title="enum uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::option::Option"><code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code></a></code>,
then that operation can be used to move a <code>T</code> out of a pinned <code>Struct&lt;T&gt;</code> – which
means pinning cannot be structural for the field holding this data.</p>
<p>For a more complex example of moving data out of a pinned type,
imagine if <a href="../cell/struct.RefCell.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::cell::RefCell"><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> had a method
<code>fn get_pin_mut(self: <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut Self</code></a>&gt;) -&gt; <a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut T</code></a>&gt;</code>.
Then we could do the following:</p>

<div class="example-wrap compile_fail"><a href="#" class="tooltip" title="This example deliberately fails to compile">ⓘ</a><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">fn </span>exploit_ref_cell&lt;T&gt;(rc: Pin&lt;<span class="kw-2">&amp;mut </span>RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;) {
    <span class="comment">// Here we get pinned access to the `T`.
    </span><span class="kw">let _</span>: Pin&lt;<span class="kw-2">&amp;mut </span>T&gt; = rc.as_mut().get_pin_mut();

    <span class="comment">// And here we have `&amp;mut T` to the same data.
    </span><span class="kw">let </span>shared: <span class="kw-2">&amp;</span>RefCell&lt;T&gt; = rc.into_ref().get_ref();
    <span class="kw">let </span>borrow = shared.borrow_mut();
    <span class="kw">let </span>content = <span class="kw-2">&amp;mut *</span>borrow;
}</code></pre></div>
<p>This is catastrophic: it means we can first pin the content of the
<a href="../cell/struct.RefCell.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::cell::RefCell"><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> (using <code><a href="../cell/struct.RefCell.html" title="cell::RefCell">RefCell</a>::get_pin_mut</code>) and then move that
content using the mutable reference we got later.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="structural-pinning-examples"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#structural-pinning-examples">§</a>Structural Pinning examples</h4>
<p>For a type like <a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, both possibilities (structural pinning or not) make
sense. A <a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a> with structural pinning could have <code>get_pin</code>/<code>get_pin_mut</code>
methods to get pinning references to elements. However, it could <em>not</em> allow calling
<a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.pop" title="Vec::pop"><code>pop</code></a> on a pinned <a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a> because that would move the (structurally
pinned) contents! Nor could it allow <a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.push" title="Vec::push"><code>push</code></a>, which might reallocate and thus also
move the contents.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a> without structural pinning could
<code>impl&lt;T&gt; <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin">Unpin</a> for <a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a></code>, because the contents are never pinned
and the <a href="../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a> itself is fine with being moved as well.
At that point pinning just has no effect on the vector at all.</p>
<p>In the standard library, pointer types generally do not have structural pinning,
and thus they do not offer pinning projections. This is why <code><a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a>: <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin">Unpin</a></code>
holds for all <code>T</code>. It makes sense to do this for pointer types, because moving the
<a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> does not actually move the <code>T</code>: the <a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> can be freely
movable (aka <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a>) even if the <code>T</code> is not. In fact, even <code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a>&gt;</code> and
<code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut T</code></a>&gt;</code> are always <a href="../marker/trait.Unpin.html" title="trait uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::marker::Unpin"><code>Unpin</code></a> themselves, for the same reason:
their contents (the <code>T</code>) are pinned, but the pointers themselves can be moved without moving
the pinned data. For both <a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> and <code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a>&gt;</code>,
whether the content is pinned is entirely independent of whether the
pointer is pinned, meaning pinning is <em>not</em> structural.</p>
<p>When implementing a <a href="../future/trait.Future.html" title="future::Future"><code>Future</code></a> combinator, you will usually need structural pinning
for the nested futures, as you need to get pinning (<a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin"><code>Pin</code></a>-wrapped) references to them to
call <a href="../future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll" title="future::Future::poll"><code>poll</code></a>. But if your combinator contains any other data that does not need to be pinned,
you can make those fields not structural and hence freely access them with a
mutable reference even when you just have <code><a href="struct.Pin.html" title="struct uniffi::deps::static_assertions::_core::pin::Pin">Pin</a>&lt;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.77.1/std/primitive.reference.html" title="primitive reference"><code>&amp;mut Self</code></a>&gt;</code>
(such as in your own <a href="../future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll" title="future::Future::poll"><code>poll</code></a> implementation).</p>
