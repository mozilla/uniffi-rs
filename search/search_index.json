To help with this, we define the <code>FfiConverter</code> trait which contains the code to lift/lower/serialize a particular type.</p> <p>The most straightforward approach would be to define <code>FfiConverter</code> on the type being lifted/lowered/serialized.  However, this wouldn't work for remote types defined in 3rd-party crates because of the Rust orphan rules.  For example, our crates can't implement <code>FfiConverter</code> on <code>serde_json::Value</code> because both the trait and the type are remote.</p> <p>To work around this we do several things:</p> <ul> <li><code>FfiConverter</code> gets a generic type parameter.  This type is basically arbitrary and doesn't affect the lowering/lifting/serialization process.</li> <li>We generate a unit struct named <code>UniFfiTag</code> in the root of each UniFFIed crate.</li> <li>Each crate uses the <code>FfiConverter&lt;crate::UniFfiTag&gt;</code> trait to lower/lift/serialize values for its scaffolding functions.</li> </ul> <p>This allows us to work around the orphan rules when defining <code>FfiConverter</code> implementations.  - UniFFI consumer crates can implement lifting/lowering/serializing types for their own scaffolding functions, for example <code>impl FfiConverter&lt;crate::UniFfiTag&gt; for serde_json::Value</code>.  This is allowed since <code>UniFfiTag</code> is a local type.  - The <code>uniffi</code> crate can implement lifting/lowering/serializing types for all scaffolding functions using a generic impl, for example <code>impl&lt;UT&gt; FfiConverter&lt;UT&gt; for u8</code>.  \"UT\" is short for \"UniFFI Tag\"  - We don't currently use this, but crates can also implement lifting/lowering/serializing their local types for all scaffolding functions using a similar generic impl (<code>impl&lt;UT&gt; FfiConverter&lt;UT&gt; for MyLocalType</code>).</p> <p>For more details on the specifics of the \"orphan rule\" and why these are legal implementations, see the Rust Chalk Book</p>"},{"location":"internals/object_references.html","title":"Managing Object References","text":"<p>UniFFI interfaces represent instances of objects that have methods and contain state.

Note that this has \"leaked\" the <code>Arc&lt;&gt;</code> reference out of Rusts ownership system and given it to the foreign-language code. The foreign-language code must pass that pointer back into Rust in order to free it, or our instance will leak.</p> <p>When invoking a method on the instance:  - The foreign-language code passes the raw pointer back to the Rust code, conceptually passing a \"borrow\" of the <code>Arc&lt;&gt;</code> to the Rust scaffolding.  - The Rust side calls <code>Arc::from_raw</code> to convert the pointer into an an <code>Arc&lt;&gt;</code>  - It wraps the <code>Arc</code> in <code>std::mem::ManuallyDrop&lt;&gt;</code>, which we never actually    drop.  This is because the Rust side is borrowing the Arc and shouldn't    run the destructor and decrement the reference count.  - The <code>Arc&lt;&gt;</code> is cloned and passed to the Rust code</p> <p>Finally, when the foreign-language code frees the instance, it passes the raw pointer a special destructor function so that the Rust code can drop that initial reference (and if that happens to be the final reference, the Rust object will be dropped.).  This simply calls <code>Arc::from_raw</code>, then lets the value drop.</p> <p>Passing instances as arguments and returning them as values works similarly, except that UniFFI does not automatically wrap/unwrap the containing <code>Arc</code>.</p> <p>To see this in action, use <code>cargo expand</code> to see the exact generated code.</p>"},{"location":"internals/rendering_foreign_bindings.html","title":"Rendering Foreign Bindings","text":"<p>This document details the general system that UniFFI uses to render the foreign bindings code.</p> <p>A language binding has to generate code for two separate but entangled requirements:</p> <ul> <li>Generate the API in the target language.</li> <li>Implement the FFI - every type needs an FfiConverter.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"internals/rendering_foreign_bindings.html#api-generation","title":"API generation","text":"<p>Our foreign bindings generation uses the Askama template rendering engine.

So if the UDL interface looked like this:</p> <pre><code>interface User {\n    // Some sort of \"user\" object that can own todo items\n};\n\ndictionary TodoEntry {\n    User owner;\n    string text;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Then the corresponding Rust code would need to look like this:</p> <pre><code>struct TodoEntry {\n    owner: std::sync::Arc&lt;User&gt;,\n    text: String,\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Depending on the language, the foreign-language bindings may also need to be aware of these embedded references. For example in Kotlin, each Object instance must be explicitly destroyed to avoid leaking the underlying memory, and this also applies to Objects stored in record fields.</p> <p>You can read more about managing object references in the section on interfaces.</p>"},{"location":"udl/structs.html#default-values-for-fields","title":"Default values for fields","text":"<p>Fields can be specified with a default value:</p> <pre><code>dictionary TodoEntry {\n    boolean done = false;\n    string text;\n};\n</code></pre> <p>The corresponding generated Kotlin code would be equivalent to:</p> <pre><code>data class TodoEntry (\n    var done: Boolean = false,\n    var text: String\n)  {\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This works for Swift and Python targets too.
