/// Support for passing an allocated-by-Rust buffer of bytes over the FFI.
///
/// We can pass a `Vec<u8>` to foreign language code by decomposing it into
/// its raw parts (buffer pointer, length, and capacity) and passing those
/// around as a struct. Naturally, this can be tremendously unsafe! So here
/// are the details:
///
///   * `RustBuffer` structs must only ever be constructed from a `Vec<u8>`,
///     either explicitly via `RustBuffer::from_vec` or indirectly by calling
///     one of the `RustBuffer::new*` constructors.
///
///   * `RustBuffer` structs do not implement `Drop`, since they are intended
///     to be passed to foreign-language code outside of the control of Rust's
///     ownership system. To avoid memory leaks they *must* passed back into
///     Rust and either explicitly destroyed using `RustBuffer::destroy`, or
///     converted back to a `Vec<u8>` using `RustBuffer::destroy_into_vec`
///     (which will then be dropped via Rust's usual ownership-tracking system).
///
/// Foreign-language code should not construct `RustBuffer` structs other than
/// by receiving them from a call into the Rust code, and should not modify them
/// apart from the following safe operations:
///
///   * Writing bytes into the buffer pointed to by `data`, without writing
///     beyond the indicated `capacity`.
///
///   * Adjusting the `len` property to indicate the amount of data written,
///     while ensuring that 0 <= `len` <= `capacity`.
///
///   * As a special case, constructing a `RustBuffer` with zero capacity, zero
///     length, and a null `data` pointer to indicate an empty buffer.
///
/// In particular, it is not safe for foreign-language code to construct a `RustBuffer`
/// that points to its own allocated memory; use the `ForeignBytes` struct to
/// pass a view of foreign-owned memory in to Rust code.
///
/// Implementation note: all the fields of this struct are private, so you can't
/// manually construct instances that don't come from a `Vec<u8>`. If you've got
/// a `RustBuffer` then it either came from a public constructor (all of which
/// are safe) or it came from foreign-language code (which should have in turn
/// received it by calling some Rust function, and should be respecting the
/// invariants listed above).
///

/// to retain unallocated capacity rather than truncating to the occupied length.
