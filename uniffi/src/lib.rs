//! # Runtime support code for uniffi
//!
//! This crate provides the small amount of runtime code that is required by the generated uniffi
//! component scaffolding in order to transfer data back and forth across the C-style FFI layer,
//! as well as some utilities for testing the generated bindings.
//!
//! The key concept here is the [`ViaFfi`] trait, which must be implemented for any type that can
//! be passed across the FFI, and which determines:
//!
//!  * How to [represent](ViaFfi::Value) values of that type in the low-level C-style type
//!    system of the FFI layer.
//!  * How to ["lower"](ViaFfi::lower) rust values of that type into an appropriate low-level
//!    FFI value.
//!  * How to ["lift"](ViaFfi::lift) low-level FFI values back into rust values of that type.
//!  * How to [write](ViaFfi::write) rust values of that type into a buffer, for cases
//!    where they are part of a compound data structure that is serialized for transfer.
//!  * How to [read](ViaFfi::read) rust values of that type from buffer, for cases
//!    where they are received as part of a compound data structure that was serialized for transfer.
//!
//! This logic encapsulates the rust-side handling of data transfer. Each foreign-language binding
//! must also implement a matching set of data-handling rules for each data type.
//!
//! In addition to the core` ViaFfi` trait, we provide a handful of struct definitions useful
//! for passing core rust types over the FFI, such as [`RustBuffer`].
