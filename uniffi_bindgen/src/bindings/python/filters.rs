/// Template filters for Askama
///
/// In general, prefer adding fields using a pipeline pass to writing filters.
/// That's allows devs to use the `pipeline` command to follow what's going on.
///
/// We currently only use filter functions when we want to implement somewhat complex display
/// logic, like in the `docstring` filter. Implementing this as a pipeline pass means the pass
/// would need to know how much each docstring gets indented, which doesn't seem right.
use askama::Result;

/// Get the idiomatic Python rendering of docstring
///
/// If the docstring is set, this returns an indented Python docstring with
/// a trailing newline. If not, it returns the empty string.
///
/// This makes it so the template code can use something like
/// `{{ item.docstring|docstring(4) -}}` to render the correct docstring in both cases.
pub fn docstring(
    docstring: &Option<String>,
    _: &dyn askama::Values,
