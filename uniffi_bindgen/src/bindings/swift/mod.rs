//! # Swift bindings backend for UniFFI
//!
//! This module generates Swift bindings from a [`ComponentInterface`] definition,
//! using Swift's builtin support for loading C header files.
//!
//! Conceptually, the generated bindings are split into two Swift modules, one for the low-level
//! C FFI layer and one for the higher-level Swift bindings. For a UniFFI component named "example"
//! we generate:
//!
//!   * A C header file `exampleFFI.h` declaring the low-level structs and functions for calling
//!    into Rust, along with a corresponding `exampleFFI.modulemap` to expose them to Swift.
//!
//!   * A Swift source file `example.swift` that imports the `exampleFFI` module and wraps it
//!    to provide the higher-level Swift API.
//!
//! Most of the concepts in a [`ComponentInterface`] have an obvious counterpart in Swift,
//! with the details documented in inline comments where appropriate.
//!
//! To handle lifting/lowering/serializing types across the FFI boundary, the Swift code
//! defines a `protocol ViaFfi` that is analogous to the `uniffi::ViaFfi` Rust trait.
//! Each type that can traverse the FFI conforms to the `ViaFfi` protocol, which specifies:
//!
//!  * The corresponding low-level type.
//!  * How to lift from and lower into into that type.
//!  * How to read from and write into a byte buffer.
//!
