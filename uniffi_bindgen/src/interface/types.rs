//! # Basic typesystem for defining a component interface.
//!
//! Our typesystem operates at two distinct levels: "API-level types" and "FFI-level types".
//!
//! The [Type] enum represents high-level types that would appear in the public API of
//! a component, such as enums and records as well as primitives like ints and strings.
//! The rust code that implements a component, and the foreign language bindings that consume it,
//! will both typically deal with such types as their core concern.
//!
//! The [FFIType] enum represents low-level types that are used internally by our generated
//! code for passing data back and forth across the C-style FFI between rust and the foreign
//! language. These cover a much more restricted set of possible types. Consumers of a
//! uniffi component should not need to care about FFI-level types at all.
//!
//! As a developer working on uniffi itself, you're likely to spend a fair bit of time thinking
//! about how the API-level types map into FFI-level types and back again.
//!
//! The set of all [Type]s used in a component interface is represented by a [TypeUniverse],
//! which can be used by the bindings generator code to determine what type-related helper
//! functions to emit for a given component.
