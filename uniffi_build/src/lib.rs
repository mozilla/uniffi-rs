/// Given the path to an UDL file, this function will call the `uniffi-bindgen`
/// command-line tool to generate the `pub extern "C"` functions and other supporting
/// code required to expose the defined interface from Rust. The expectation is that
/// this will be called from a crate's build script, and the resulting file will
/// be `include!()`ed into the build.
///
/// Given an UDL file named `example.udl`, the generated scaffolding will be written
/// into a file named `example.uniffi.rs` in the `$OUT_DIR` directory.
///
/// If the "builtin-bindgen" feature is enabled then this will take a dependency on
/// the `uniffi_bindgen` crate and call its methods directly, rather than using the
/// command-line tool. This is mostly useful for developers who are working on uniffi
/// itself and need to test out their changes to the bindings generator.
