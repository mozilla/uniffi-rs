//! Traits that define how to transfer values via the FFI layer.
//!
//! These traits define how to pass values over the FFI in various ways: as arguments or as return
//! values, from Rust to the foreign side and vice-versa.  These traits are mainly used by the
//! proc-macro generated code.  The goal is to allow the proc-macros to go from a type name to the
//! correct function for a given FFI operation.
//!
//! The traits form a sort-of tree structure from general to specific:
//! ```ignore
//!
//!                   [FfiConverter]
//!                        |
//!           -----------------------------
//!           |                           |
//!       [Lower]                      [Lift]
//!           |                           |
//!           |                       --------------
//!           |                       |            |
//!       [LowerReturn]           [LiftRef]  [LiftReturn]
//! ```
//!
//! The `derive_ffi_traits` macro can be used to derive the specific traits from the general ones.
//! Here's the main ways we implement these traits:
//!
//! * For most types we implement [FfiConverter] and use [derive_ffi_traits] to implement the rest
//! * If a type can only be lifted/lowered, then we implement [Lift] or [Lower] and use
//!   [derive_ffi_traits] to implement the rest
//! * If a type needs special-case handling, like `Result<>` and `()`, we implement the traits
//!   directly.
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! All traits are unsafe (implementing it requires `unsafe impl`) because we can't guarantee
//! that it's safe to pass your type out to foreign-language code and back again. Buggy
//! implementations of this trait might violate some assumptions made by the generated code,
//! or might not match with the corresponding code in the generated foreign-language bindings.
//! These traits should not be used directly, only in generated code, and the generated code should
//! have fixture tests to test that everything works correctly together.
