//! # Runtime support code for uniffi
//!
//! This crate provides the small amount of runtime code that is required by the generated uniffi
//! component scaffolding in order to transfer data back and forth across the C-style FFI layer,
//! as well as some utilities for testing the generated bindings.
//!
//! The key concept here is the [`FfiConverter`] trait, which is responsible for converting between
//! a Rust type and a low-level C-style type that can be passed across the FFI:
//!
//!  * How to [represent](FfiConverter::FfiType) values of the Rust type in the low-level C-style type
//!    system of the FFI layer.
//!  * How to ["lower"](FfiConverter::lower) values of the Rust type into an appropriate low-level
//!    FFI value.
//!  * How to ["lift"](FfiConverter::try_lift) low-level FFI values back into values of the Rust
//!    type.
//!  * How to [write](FfiConverter::write) values of the Rust type into a buffer, for cases
//!    where they are part of a compound data structure that is serialized for transfer.
//!  * How to [read](FfiConverter::try_read) values of the Rust type from buffer, for cases
//!    where they are received as part of a compound data structure that was serialized for transfer.
//!  * How to [return](FfiConverter::lower_return) values of the Rust type from scaffolding
//!    functions.
//!
//! This logic encapsulates the Rust-side handling of data transfer. Each foreign-language binding
//! must also implement a matching set of data-handling rules for each data type.
//!
//! In addition to the core `FfiConverter` trait, we provide a handful of struct definitions useful
//! for passing core rust types over the FFI, such as [`RustBuffer`].

/// Trait defining how to transfer values via the FFI layer.
///
/// The `FfiConverter` trait defines how to pass values of a particular type back-and-forth over
/// the uniffi generated FFI layer, both as standalone argument or return values, and as
/// part of serialized compound data structures. `FfiConverter` is mainly used in generated code.
/// The goal is to make it easy for the code generator to name the correct FFI-related function for
/// a given type.
///
/// FfiConverter has a generic parameter, that's filled in with a type local to the UniFFI consumer crate.
/// This allows us to work around the Rust orphan rules for remote types. See
/// `https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/internals/lifting_and_lowering.html#code-generation-and-the-fficonverter-trait`
/// for details.
///
/// ## Scope
///
/// It could be argued that FfiConverter handles too many concerns and should be split into
/// separate traits (like `FfiLiftAndLower`, `FfiSerialize`, `FfiReturn`).  However, there are good
/// reasons to keep all the functionality in one trait.
///
/// The main reason is that splitting the traits requires fairly complex blanket implementations,
/// for example `impl<UT, T> FfiReturn<UT> for T: FfiLiftAndLower<UT>`.  Writing these impls often
/// means fighting with `rustc` over what counts as a conflicting implementation.  In fact, as of
/// Rust 1.66, that previous example conflicts with `impl<UT> FfiReturn<UT> for ()`, since other
/// crates can implement `impl FfiReturn<MyLocalType> for ()`. In general, this path gets
/// complicated very quickly and that distracts from the logic that we want to define, which is
/// fairly simple.
///
/// The main downside of having a single `FfiConverter` trait is that we need to implement it for
/// types that only support some of the functionality.  For example, `Result<>` supports returning
/// values, but not lifting/lowering/serializing them.  This is a bit weird, but works okay --
/// especially since `FfiConverter` is rarely used outside of generated code.
///
/// ## Safety
///
/// This is an unsafe trait (implementing it requires `unsafe impl`) because we can't guarantee
/// that it's safe to pass your type out to foreign-language code and back again. Buggy
/// implementations of this trait might violate some assumptions made by the generated code,
/// or might not match with the corresponding code in the generated foreign-language bindings.
///
/// In general, you should not need to implement this trait by hand, and should instead rely on
/// implementations generated from your component UDL via the `uniffi-bindgen scaffolding` command.

    /// which values of the target rust type can be converted.
    ///
    /// For complex data types, we currently recommend using `RustBuffer` and serializing
    /// the data for transfer. In theory it could be possible to build a matching
