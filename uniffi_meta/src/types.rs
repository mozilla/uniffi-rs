//! # Basic typesystem for defining a component interface.
//!
//! This module provides the "API-level" typesystem of a UniFFI Rust Component, that is,
//! the types provided by the Rust implementation and consumed callers of the foreign language
//! bindings. Think "objects" and "enums" and "records".
//!
//! The [`Type`] enum represents high-level types that would appear in the public API of
//! a component, such as enums and records as well as primitives like ints and strings.
//! The Rust code that implements a component, and the foreign language bindings that consume it,
//! will both typically deal with such types as their core concern.
//!
//! As a developer working on UniFFI itself, you're likely to spend a fair bit of time thinking
//! about how these API-level types map into the lower-level types of the FFI layer as represented
//! by the [`ffi::FfiType`](super::ffi::FfiType) enum, but that's a detail that is invisible to end users.
